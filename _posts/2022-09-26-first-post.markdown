Hello World! this is my first post of the year so I would just to say a warm welcome to everyone who is seeing this. I am a 16 year old High School Student living in New Zealand. My hobbies include programming, hacking, and skating. I have been programming since 2015. My first programming language was haxe which I was introduced to by my brother. We wrote an arena game using the [HaxePunk][haxepunk-git] game engine.

I use the Archlinux distro of the Linux operating system and have a big habit of installing many things from source and taking up a lot of space in my computer.
